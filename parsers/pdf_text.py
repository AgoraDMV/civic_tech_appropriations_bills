"""PDF text extraction with the smallest set of primitives that fixture cases require.

Text is extracted with pypdfium2 (PDFium, Chrome's PDF engine). `Page` is
line-aware: every cleaned `Line` carries the source PDF's printed line number
(1-based, the small digit GPO renders in the left margin). Phase 2 uses those
numbers to produce hunk citations like `p.61 L5` and to attach anchor breadcrumbs
by binary-searching the anchor list. The page-level `text` property is a derived
join, so existing consumers (recall test, `page_range_text`) keep working without
change.

PDFium's raw page text needs three normalizations before the line-numbered cleaner
can read it (`normalize_raw`): CRLF endings, soft-hyphenated breaks rendered as a
U+FFFE glyph with the next margin number glued inline, and footer chrome glued onto
a line whose word hyphenates onto the next page. The running `•HR` header also
floats to the top of the reading order, so chrome stripping (`strip_page_chrome`)
removes it in place rather than from the bottom.
